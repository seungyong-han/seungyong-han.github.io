<p>
I am a senior researcher at Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI). My research interests are in the areas of deep learning and control theory.
</p>

<p>
During my PhD at Kyungpook National University (KNU), I worked with Prof. <a href="https://control.knu.ac.kr">Sangmoon Lee</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/departments/academic-departments/electrical-and-electronic-engineering/staff/suneel-kommuri">Suneel Kumar Kommuri</a>. My research focused on how to stabilize networked control systems (NCSs) in the presence of network-induced problems. Particularly, I developed the sampled‐parameter‐dependent looped‐functional (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/rnc.5454">SPDLF</a>) approach for NCSs with multiple sampling. This approach can be used to design a sampled-data controller which stabilizes NCSs while it's sampling is asynchronously updated.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, I have participated in R&D projects related to a multi-degree of freedom manipulator. In the project, I developed <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9382115">Luenberger's type sliding mode observer design</a> method for the external torque estimation. This method is used to estimate an external torque acting on the manipulator without any torque sensors.
