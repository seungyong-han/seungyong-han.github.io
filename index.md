I am a senior researcher at Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI). My research interests are in the areas of deep learning and control theory.

During my PhD at Kyungpook National University (KNU), I worked with Prof. <a href="https://control.knu.ac.kr">Sangmoon Lee</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/departments/academic-departments/electrical-and-electronic-engineering/staff/suneel-kommuri")>Suneel Kumar Kommuri</a>. My research focused on how to stabilize networked control systems (NCSs) in the presence of network-induced problems. Particularly, I developed the sampled‐parameter‐dependent looped‐functional ([SPDLF](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/rnc.5454 )) approach for NCSs with multiple sampling. This approach can be used to design a sampled-data controller which stabilizes NCSs while it's sampling is asynchronously updated.

Moreover, I have participated in a R&D project on a multi-degree of freedom manipulator. In this project, I developed [Luenberger's type sliding mode observer design](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9382115) method for the external torque estimation. This method is used to estimate an external torque acting on the manipulator without any torque sensors.
